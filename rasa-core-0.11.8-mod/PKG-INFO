          [How to contribute](#how-to-contribute)
        
        
        ## Introduction
        
        Rasa Core is a framework for building conversational software, which includes
        Chat Bots on :
        - Facebook Messenger
        - Slack
        - Microsoft Bot Framework
        - Rocket.Chat
        - Mattermost
        - Telegram
        - Twilio
        
        But you can also build assistants as
        - Alexa Skills
        - Google Home Actions
        
        Rasa Core's primary purpose is to help you build contextual, layered 
        conversations with lots of back-and-forth. To have a real conversation, 
        you need to have some memory and build on things that were said earlier.
        Rasa Core lets you do that in a scalable way.
        
        There's a lot more background information in this 
        [blog post](https://medium.com/rasa-blog/a-new-approach-to-conversational-software-2e64a5d05f2a)
        
        ## Where to get help
        
        There is extensive documentation:
        
        - [master](https://rasa.com/docs/core/master/)&nbsp; 
          (if you install from **github**) or 
        - [stable](https://rasa.com/docs/core)&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          (if you install from **pypi**)

        ### README Contents:
        - [How to contribute](#how-to-contribute)

        - [License](#license)
        
        ### How to contribute
        We are very happy to receive and merge your contributions. There is 
        some more information about the style of the code and docs in the 
        [documentation](https://nlu.rasa.com/contribute.html).
        
        In general the process is rather simple:
        1. create an issue describing the feature you want to work on (or 
           have a look at issues with the label 
           [help wanted](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22))
        2. write your code, tests and documentation
        3. create a pull request describing your changes
        
        You pull request will be reviewed by a maintainer, who might get 
        back to you about any necessary changes or questions. You will 
        also be asked to sign a 
        [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/RasaHQ/rasa_core)
        
        
        ## Development Internals
        ### Running and changing the documentation
        To build & edit the docs, first install all necessary dependencies:
        
        ```
        brew install sphinx
        pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
        ```
        
        After the installation has finished, you can run and view the documentation
        locally using
        ```
        make livedocs
        ```
        
        Visit the local version of the docs at http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
        You can now change the docs locally and the web page will automatically reload
        and apply your changes.
